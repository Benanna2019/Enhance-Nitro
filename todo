[x] - inject auth as plugin
[x] - start working with data (maybe unjs mongo package?) _Went with Turso Sqlite_
[x] - setup auth handlers
[] - setup landing page
[] - basic color pallete from happy hues
[] - simple header
[] - login/register/logout flow
[] - htmx for better client side implementation (in web components as a progressive enhancement)
[] - abstract all loading of elements and what not. 
[] - figure out where I am uploading photos (upload thing?)
[] - Prompt is generated by user 
[] - any other user specific data initially? (user settings?)

<!-- These below are more general 'framework' goals -->
<!-- This app has morphed into an actual app so these are not relevant anymore -->
[] - make generic handler that injects plugins
[ ] - get basic LiveStore Todos example working (client side)
[ ] - setup LiveStore SSR (github link - )
[ ] - look into reactivity with signals (specific to SSR examples without local first look into how datastar is doing this)
[ ] - WASM route handlers? (try writing a route handler in Go)
[ ] - Dynamo DB (long way then move to begin/data)
[ ] - GraphQL api's - Use dataloaders and graphql api's to fetch data

[] should probably copy this repo to another nitro project
[] need to setup some login/register/logout routes
[] need to setup a landing page
[] once logged in, should go to first days prompt
[] figure out good flow for how often they need to login/should be automatically logged out
[] just start with sqlite for now.should probably use Turso for a db. not sure how sqlite on the server for a person would scale but seems like it should be fine. Turso just gives full dbs to people so that would be cool.
[] Upload thing for images? Or just store in sqlite? 
[] install tailwind 
[] use htmx or fixi.js 
[] make the htmx/fixi a progressive enhancement step
